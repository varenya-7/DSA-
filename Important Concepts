Important Concepts

=> Shorcut to find Number of Digits
* if number is negative [num=num * =1;]

int numberOfDigits(int num){
 return (int)(Math.log10(num)) + 1;
}

=> ORDER-AGNOSTIC BINARY SEARCH
*It is applied when we don't know weather the given array is Sorted in ascending or descending order
*So we compare the first and the last element and apply binary search accordingly

=> Find Length of an Array without Length Function 
*length=(end - start + 1)

=> BITONIC ARRAY
*its is the array which is half sorted in ascending order and half sorted in descending order with the middle element as the highest element
*Not always divided in equal parts parts maybe variable
