=> Properties of Modulo
* (a + b) % m = ((a % m) + (b % m)) % m;
* (a - b) % m = ((a % m) - (b % m)) % m;
* (a * b) % m = ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m;
* (a / b) % m = ((a % m) * (b^-1 % m)) % m;
* (a % m) % m = a % m;
* [m^x] % [m] = 0; {for all x = +ve numbers}


-> {b^-1 % m} =Multiplicative Modulo Inverse; {this means [b^-1] & [m] are CoPrimes}
Example - (6 * y) % 7 = 1
        *here y is MMI for 6 && y=6;
        *(6 * 6) % 7 = (36 % 7) = 1 ;
      
      
[DIE HARD PROBLEM STATEMENT]       
=> HcF of [a & b] = minimum positive value of equation (ax +by);
  *where x & y are the integers
  
=> let a be bucket A
=> let b be bucket B

ax + by = Total value needed should be divided by the HCF of both bucket
Example
3x + 6y = 9
 3(x + 3y) = 9
  (x + 3y) = 9 / 3;
  :> as 9 is divided by 3 so it is possible that 9 lt jug can be filled by 3 lt and lt jug;
